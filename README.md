## Hi there 👋
I’m Sahil Tomar — AI/ML dev, system thinker, and builder of multi-agent chaos (the good kind).

🧠 Currently working with LLMs, RAG stacks, and Google's ADK to make AI more real-time, modular, and useful.

⚙️ I prototype fast, fail smart, and ship cleaner than my browser history.
📦 Whether it’s pipelines, agents, or APIs — if it scales, I’m in.
